# This file runs once at login, before ~/.zshrc

# Set PATH to include user's private bin if it exists

# Set PATH to include user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Note: The following line was removed as it's Linux-specific (snap/codium):
# . "$HOME/snap/codium/496/.local/share/../bin/env"
# VSCodium on macOS is installed via Homebrew and doesn't need this.
